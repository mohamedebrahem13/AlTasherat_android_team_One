Technologies Used
Kotlin: The primary language for development.
Retrofit: For handling API requests and responses.
Kotlin Coroutines: For background threading and asynchronous operations.
Flow and StateFlow: To manage data streams and UI states.
MVI (Model-View-Intent): Architecture pattern for managing state and user interactions.
Encryption: To ensure secure data storage and transmission.
Product Flavors: Configurations to support different versions of the app, tailored to various needs or markets.
ViewBinding: For type-safe access to views in the layout files, reducing the need for findViewById calls and improving code safety.
Coil: For efficient image loading and caching.
Data Store: For storing small amounts of key-value data in a type-safe manner, replacing SharedPreferences.

Architecture
MVI (Model-View-Intent)
MVI is an architecture pattern used to handle state management and user interactions in a predictable manner. In the AlTasherat app, MVI was utilized to ensure clear separation of concerns and a unidirectional data flow, enhancing the app's scalability and maintainability.

Model: Represents the application's state and business logic. It handles data operations and updates the state based on user actions or other events.
View: Displays the UI and renders the state to the user. It listens to user interactions and sends intents to the Model.
Intent: Represents user actions or events that trigger changes in the Model. Intents are processed by the Model to update the application's state.
By adopting MVI, the AlTasherat app ensures that the state management and UI logic are cleanly separated, leading to more predictable behavior and easier debugging.
