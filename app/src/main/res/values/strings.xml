Egypt is one of the most popular tourist destinations on the traveler\'s list of happiness from the first visit and forever. Egypt is the only tourist destination in the world that does not recognize the final exit visa without return, as it is an icon of attraction in the Middle East. There is no logical explanation for the multiple and repeated visits of travelers to Egypt, and this secret will remain buried in the golden sands of Egypt and has nothing to do with the waters of the Nile, as the Egyptians say.
who are we? Egypt Key is the number one tourism app. It is also the comprehensive and specialized guide that includes details of Egyptian attractions and information about historical places and ancient monuments in Egypt. It is also an ideal digital medium for all tourism lovers.</string>
